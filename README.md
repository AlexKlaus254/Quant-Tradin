# Backtesting everything

This GitHub repository contains the code used to backtest different trading strategies with stocks. The main goal of this project is to explore and compare different trading strategies to see which ones perform the best. To accomplish this, we will be using Python to gather historical stock price data and implement different trading algorithms. The code in this repository includes a script to download and prepare the data for analysis, as well as code to implement and backtest various trading strategies.
